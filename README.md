# Document Graph

## Simple Summary

This specification defines an abstraction data structure that can be used for flexible/variant key-value pairs in a smart contract. 

## Features

- [Content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/how-ipfs-works/#content-addressing)
- Akin to IPFS log or Git, documents are read-only and changes are appended as a new 'document' (node in the graph)
- Document content, not just the hash, is store on chain so that it can be used in smart contracts
- (*perhaps implementation specific*) Documents can be certified or 'signed' by other accounts
- Supports key eosio data types: ```name, int64, asset, time_point, string, and checksum256```
- Data elements (see below) support both optional labeling and sequencing

## Data Structure

The core on-chain storage element is variant:

``` c++
    // flexvalue can any of these commonly used eosio data types
    // a checksum256 can be a link to another document, akin to an "edge" on a graph
    typedef std::variant<name, string, asset, time_point, int64_t, checksum256> flexvalue;
```

Flex values may be labeled as they are encapsulated into a content object.
``` c++
      struct content
      {
         string label;
         flexvalue value;
      };
```

Which are grouped: 
``` c++
    typedef vector<content> content_group;
```

And a ```document``` supports a vector of ```content_group```, a hash of these groups, plus additional metadata:
``` c++
    struct [[eosio::table]] document
    {
        uint64_t                id;
        checksum256             hash;
        name                    creator;
        vector<content_group>   content_groups;
        ...
    };
```

#### Certificates (implementation specific?)

Any document may be ```certified```, which is meant as an attestation, approval, signature, or a related use case depending on the specific needs. 

## Content Addressing

*This can surely be improved upon for performance and scale*

In the current implementation, a ```document``` hash is a ```checksum256``` of the concatenation of the string representation of the ```vector<content_group>```.

If a 2nd identical document is attempted to be created, it fails, ensuring automatic de-duplication of content. 

Since certificates are added after ```document``` creation, they are of course not included in the hashing fingerprint. 

### Fork (Edit)

A ```document``` may be edited or 'forked'.  When this occurs, a new ```document``` is created with a link (graph edge) back to the parent ```document``` along with any content that is different than the parent.  Only diffs are stored.

A client/reader of the ```document``` can walk the graph to construct a current version. (TODO: bounds test recursion; address depth issues)

## Graph Access / Query 

Querying EOSIO via ```get_table_rows``` is notoriously complex and inefficient. Entire rows are always returned, there is no support for joining data, only a single index can be used in each query, etc. 

As this data structure is a Graph, a key component is integration to a Graph-friendly database for improved access.

### DGraph
In this implementation, we use DGraph (dgraph.io) for various reasons, but any Graph DB should be fine. Of course, proper security must be addressed when inserting records, and then the data is read-only by clients. 

Documents may be loaded with block streaming services such as dfuse or Hyperion.  Data is updated anytime a ```document``` is created or certified.

The schema (WIP):
*TODO: much improvement needed, but this works for basic insert/query*
``` graphql
      type Document {
          hash
          created_date
          creator
          content_groups
          certificates
      }
      
      type ContentGroup {
        content_group_sequence
        contents
      }
      
      type Content {
        label
        value
        type
        content_sequence
      }
      
      type Certificate {
        certifier
        notes
        certification_date
      }
      
      hash: string @index(exact) .
      created_date: datetime .
      creator: string @index(term) .
      content_groups: [uid] .
      certificates: [uid] .
      
      content_group_sequence: int .
      contents: [uid] .
      
      label: string @index(term) .
      value: string @index(term) .
      type: string @index(term) .
      content_sequence: int .
      
      certifier: string @index(term) .
      notes: string .
      certification_date: datetime .
```

## Implementation

The current implementation, a work-in-process, is located: https://github.com/hypha-dao/document

Test data has been loaded into a contract on the Telos testnet.  

Quick look:
```
cleos -u https://test.telos.kitchen get table -r docs.hypha docs.hypha documents
```

### npm package
An npm package is being developed to abstract the transformation of documents between the EOSIO required format and the DGraph required format so that it is transparent to clients.

## IPLD integration (extra credit)

> IPLD is the data model of the content-addressable web. It allows us to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified information space, unifying all data models that link data with hashes as instances of IPLD.

Content addressing through hashes has become a widely-used means of connecting data in distributed systems, from the blockchains that run your favorite cryptocurrencies, to the commits that back your code, to the webâ€™s content at large. Yet, whilst all of these tools rely on some common primitives, their specific underlying data structures are not interoperable.

Enter IPLD: a single namespace for all hash-inspired protocols. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, allowing you to explore data regardless of the underlying protocol.

Implementing ```document``` as an IPLD type will enable seamless integration with [IPLD Explorer](https://explore.ipld.io/) and other commonly used web3 technologies, independent of the underlying protocol.

- should we support multi-directional graphs or limit to [DAGs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/)?
