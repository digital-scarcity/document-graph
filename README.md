# Document Graph

## Simple Summary
This specification defines an abstraction data structure that can be used for flexible/variant key-value pairs in a smart contract. 

## Use Cases
- Facilitates creation/evolution of consensus among humans on human-readable and machine-interpreted documents, such as real-world contracts
- On-chain enforcement of business rules contained in documents
- Easier handling of variant data within a smart contract, particularly change management (devX)
- Greatly improved query and access capabilities

## Features
- [Content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/how-ipfs-works/#content-addressing)
- Akin to IPFS log or Git, documents are read-only and changes are appended as a new 'document' (node in the graph)
- Document content, not just an anchored hash, is stored on chain so that it can be used in smart contracts
- (*perhaps implementation specific*) Documents can be certified or 'signed' by other accounts
- Supports key eosio data types: ```name, int64, asset, time_point, string, and checksum256```
- Data elements (see below) support both optional labeling and sequencing
- Markdown support

## Data Structure
The core on-chain storage element is variant:

``` c++
    // flexvalue can any of these commonly used eosio data types
    // a checksum256 can be a link to another document, akin to an "edge" on a graph
    typedef std::variant<name, string, asset, time_point, int64_t, checksum256> flexvalue;
```

Flex values may be labeled as they are encapsulated into a content object.
``` c++
      struct content
      {
         string label;
         flexvalue value;
      };
```

Which are grouped: 
``` c++
    typedef vector<content> content_group;
```

And a ```document``` supports a vector of ```content_group```, a hash of these groups, plus additional metadata:
``` c++
    struct [[eosio::table]] document
    {
        uint64_t                id;
        checksum256             hash;
        name                    creator;
        vector<content_group>   content_groups;
        vector<certificate>     certificates;

        uint64_t primary_key() const { return id; }
        uint64_t by_creator() const { return creator.value; }
        checksum256 by_hash() const { return hash; }

        time_point created_date = current_time_point();
        uint64_t by_created() const { return created_date.sec_since_epoch(); }
    };
```

#### Certificates (implementation specific?)
Any document may be ```certified```, which is meant as an attestation, approval, signature, or a related use case depending on the specific needs. 

> Certificates are not required generally but they are a key element in multiple use cases for which this spec was designed for.
``` c++
    struct certificate
    {
        name        certifier;
        string      notes;
        time_point  certification_date = current_time_point();
    };
```

Of course, certificate creation requires the authority of the certifier.

## Content Addressing
*This can surely be improved upon for performance and scale, likely using bytes instead of strings, which are used in the imlementation for clarity*

In the current implementation, a ```document``` hash is a ```checksum256``` of the concatenation of the string representation of the ```vector<content_group>```.

If a 2nd identical document is attempted to be created, it fails, ensuring automatic de-duplication of content. 

Since certificates are added after ```document``` creation, they are of course not included in the hashing fingerprint. 

### Fork (Edit)

A ```document``` may be edited or 'forked'.  When this occurs, a new ```document``` is created with a link (graph edge) back to the parent ```document``` along with any content that is different than the parent.  Only diffs are stored.

A client/reader of the ```document``` can walk the graph to construct a current version. (TODO: bounds test recursion; address depth issues)

## Graph Access / Query 

Querying EOSIO via ```get_table_rows``` is notoriously heavy and inefficient. Entire rows are always returned, there is no support for joining data, only a single index can be used in each query, etc. 

As this data structure is a Graph, a key component is integration to a Graph-friendly database for improved access.

### DGraph
In this implementation, we use [DGraph](https://dgraph.io) for various reasons, but any Graph DB should be fine. Of course, proper security must be addressed when inserting records, and then the data is read-only by clients. 

Documents may be loaded with block streaming services such as dfuse or Hyperion.  Data is updated anytime a ```document``` is created or certified.

The schema (WIP):
*TODO: much improvement needed, but this works for basic insert/query*
``` graphql
      type Document {
        hash
        created_date
        creator
        content_groups
        certificates
      }
      
      type ContentGroup {
        content_group_sequence
        contents
      }
      
      type Content {
        label
        value
        type
        content_sequence
      }
      
      type Certificate {
        certifier
        notes
        certification_date
      }
      
      hash: string @index(exact) .
      created_date: datetime .
      creator: string @index(term) .
      content_groups: [uid] .
      certificates: [uid] .
      
      content_group_sequence: int .
      contents: [uid] .
      
      label: string @index(term) .
      value: string @index(term) .
      type: string @index(term) .
      content_sequence: int .
      
      certifier: string @index(term) .
      notes: string .
      certification_date: datetime .
```

## Implementation

The current implementation, a work-in-process, is located: https://github.com/hypha-dao/document

Test data has been loaded into a contract on the Telos testnet.  

Quick look:
```
cleos -u https://test.telos.kitchen get table -r docs.hypha docs.hypha documents
```

### npm package
An npm package abstracts the transformation of documents between the EOSIO required format and the DGraph required format so that it is transparent to clients.

## IPLD integration (extra credit)
#### What is IPLD?
> IPLD is the data model of the content-addressable web. It allows us to treat all hash-linked data structures as subsets of a unified information space, unifying all data models that link data with hashes as instances of IPLD.

> Content addressing through hashes has become a widely-used means of connecting data in distributed systems, from the blockchains that run your favorite cryptocurrencies, to the commits that back your code, to the webâ€™s content at large. Yet, whilst all of these tools rely on some common primitives, their specific underlying data structures are not interoperable.

> Enter IPLD: a single namespace for all hash-inspired protocols. Through IPLD, links can be traversed across protocols, allowing you to explore data regardless of the underlying protocol.

Implementing ```document``` as an IPLD type will enable seamless integration with [IPLD Explorer](https://explore.ipld.io/) and other commonly used web3 technologies, independent of the underlying protocol.

## Open
- should we support multi-directional graphs or limit to [DAGs](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/merkle-dag/)?
- archival strategies, such as pinning
- contextual business rules will be used when constructing documents but it's probably not part of this spec
- additional document rendering instructions beyond markdown support?
